### About the Organization

Now help us learn a bit more about the overall organization that is applying for
funding.

**Mission Statement**

Our mission is to provide every student, regardless of ethnicity, gender, or
socioeconomic status, the opportunity to experience the joys of hacking because
we believe coding is one of the most empowering things someone can learn. If
we're able to accomplish this, not only does that mean a larger and more diverse
technology workforce, but it means living in a more empowered world where more
people create the change they want to see. And that is a world we want to live
in

**Brief description of the organization**

Hack Club helps high school students start coding clubs. We provide prospective
club leaders with open-source materials for starting clubs and with a supportive
community of leaders around the globe.

Our clubs have gone on to host hackathons with hundreds of participants, build
games to destigmatize sex education, and bring coding education to traditionally
underserved and underrepresented communities.

**What were the organization's major achievements in the past year?**

We've taken Hack Club from an idea attempted at a single high school to the
beginning of an international movement in 70 schools across 16 states and 7
countries (just started a club in Pakistan!). We've helped start clubs at
schools in a variety of socioeconomic situations---from schools that are
upper-middle class with access to lots of resources to schools that have been
labeled "dropout factories".

We've developed our content significantly and are now at the point where we have
a "club in a box"---including curriculum, meeting guidelines, and
slideshows---to start clubs with.

We did our first fundraise, bringing in $165,765.00 from the Reva & David Logan
Foundation, Joe Lonsdale, the Thiel Foundation, among many other generous
supporters.

We've been featured on the TODAY Show, in the cover story of the California
Sunday, in the Daily Dot's 20 Under 20, in Business Insider, and in the Forbes
30 Under 30. The publications we've been featured in have a combined monthly
reach of 23 million people.

**Total organizational budget in 2016**

We spent $55,720.73 in 2015. As we begin to expand our team, we're expecting to
spend $200k in 2016.

**What makes your organization unique, innovative, and/or sets you apart from
other groups doing similar work?**

Our clubs and content are built and run by students, for students.

By having high schoolers lead clubs, we're able to bypass the red tape typically
associated with bringing computer science to a school or a community. Where it
can take years to start a new computer science program, starting a Hack Club can
take as little as two weeks. Our leaders don't need to find their own space (the
school is their space), recruit external volunteers (their friends are
volunteers), or hire teachers (they teach using our pre-written workshops). This
model makes the cost of starting a new club virtually $0 from our end and we
think it'll let us scale where others haven't.

Our content is entirely open source and designed for community contribution.
While we're still in the early stages of driving community contributions, half
of our curriculum has been built by the community. Having our content open
source and accessible to contribution has the advantage of being self-correcting
and continuously improved by club leaders and members.

In terms of pedagogy, our curriculum isn't built to teach people how to program:
it's built to help our club members become self-taught programmers. Instead of
starting by teaching the fundamentals, we throw our members in at the deep end
by having them build real projects and use Google when they get stuck. By the
end of the first club meeting, everyone has built their first website and
deployed it using git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages.

**Has this organization applied for, or received, funding from Google

### About the Project

Please provide us with details about the specific computer science education
project that you would like the RISE Awards to fund.

**Project name**

Hack Club (the whole organization)

**Project description (one sentence):**

Hack Club helps high schoolers start coding clubs through providing prospective
club leaders with open-source materials and a community of other leaders around
the globe.

**Detailed project description (include all activities):**

We would like RISE to fund the continued expansion of Hack Club during 2016.
Specifically, we're looking to bring someone on full-time to lead the
development of our curriculum with the community.

To expand on what Hack Club does:

[TODO]

**Which of the following formats best describes the project you are proposing in
this application:**

- [ ] Summer or holiday program (like a camp or school)
- [ ] Teacher training/workshops
- [ ] Club
- [X] Afterschool program
- [ ] Weekend program
- [ ] Mentoring
- [ ] Family workshop
- [ ] Other

**Amount of funding requested ($10,000 - $25,000 USD):**

$20,000

**Please share a budget breakdown**

_How will funding from RISE be spent?_

Salary for curriculum lead

**Project start date**

01.01.16

**Project end date**

12.31.16

**Please describe the key milestones/deliverables and timeline for this
project.**

By the end of 2016, we plan to have Hack Clubs in over 200 schools, reaching
over 4,000 students.

As we work towards this goal, we'll have to make significant strides in our
curriculum, which will be led by the curriculum lead we hire.

**Who will be leading this project? Include the title and relevant experience.**

Zach Latta, Executive Director of Hack Club.

Zach started Hack Club after he started a coding club at his high school and
wanted to be part of something larger than his school. Before working on Hack
Club full-time, Zach built the backend architecture for Yo -- an app with more
than 3 million users. Prior to that, he was a programmer of Football Heroes, a
game with over a million users.

Zach is a Thiel Fellow, part of the 2016 Forbes 30 Under 30, and part of Daily
Dot's 20 Under 20.

**Who else will be involved with this project? Include relevant experience and
recruitment strategy for additional program staff and/or volunteers.**

Zach is currently the only full-time member of Hack Club. There are a number of
community members that are very active that Zach works closely with.

We plan to recruit staff through the networks of those involved in Hack Club.
Volunteers are recruited through our existing club leader base.

**Why is this project needed in this community?**

There is a dearth of organizations in high schools that support computer science
education. Since Hack Club is the first-to-market for coding clubs, we have a
very unique opportunity to build the organization that we have always wished
existed -- one that is built by students, for students.

### Impact

Please provide more information on who will benefit from the computer science
education project if you receive funding from the RISE Awards.

**Local town (specify)**

N/A - National/international project

**Country (specify)**

Focused on the USA, but we are also starting international clubs

**Region (specify)**

Focused on North America, but we are international

**Projected total number of youth served by this project**

Other organizations that follow our model (DECA, FBLA, Key Club, etc) typically
reach between 100,000 and 300,000 students each year.

These organizations only have a presence in the USA. Since Hack Club is
international, we hope we can eventually expand our reach to the millions.

**Projected demographics of the youth reached by this project**

_Please use approximate percentages to list the demographics of the youth that
your proposed project will serve this year, such as age ranges, race/ethnicity,
gender etc. For example, 25% boys, 75% girls._

We project our demographics in 2016 to mirror those in 2015, though we do plan
on serving more young women. Our demographics in 2015 are as follows:

- 32% women (compare with 20% female AP CS test takers)
- 37% minorities in tech (compare with 13% African American/Hispanic AP CS test
  takers in USA)

**What are the anticipated results (objectives/outputs) for this project? (list
up to 5)**

Our goal is to turn members of Hack Clubs into hackers: people who create what
they see missing in the world and aren't afraid to break the rules. We'll know
this is happening if:

- Members are continuing to write code outside of Hack Club
- Members are working on long-term projects and publishing them
- Members are winning hackathons and other competitions
- Members are hosting their own events (hackathons, meetups, etc)

**How do you plan to measure and evaluate your results?**

We'll continue to measure our primary KPIs: the number of clubs and the stories
we're hearing from club leaders and members.

Additionally, we'll begin measuring attendance of Hack Clubs week-to-week and
their attrition rates.

### Sustainability and Scalability

Help us understand how the project you are proposing fits into the larger
context of your organization.

**What is the purpose of your proposal?**

- [ ] Create or add a new program to the organization
- [X] Expand an existing program to more students, a new population, or a new
  geography
- [ ] Secure funding for an existing program
- [ ] Other

**How do you plan to sustain your project beyond 2016 and beyond this grant?**

Grants and company sponsorships. We plan to continue to keep Hack Clubs free for
students by not collecting membership dues.

We're thinking about building a regional grant pipeline: a process for
consistently applying and winning grants in areas we have clubs. We're still in
the ideation phase for this.

Other ideas include creating a Hack Club gap year, where club members and
leaders could apply to take a gap year before college and work on Hack Club.
Fellowships would be sponsored by companies and foundations. We've received
preliminary interest from companies interested in sponsoring this sort of
program.

**Does this project have a post-engagement strategy to keep students connected
with computer science? If yes, please describe.**

For many programs, we are the post-engagement strategy. Our clubs meet weekly or
bi-weekly throughout the school year and we've received partnership interest
from a variety of computer science summer programs wanting their students to
start Hack Clubs after their program ends.

During the summer, when our clubs are out of session, we hope to partner with
summer programs and eventually run our own hackathons to continually engage our
members.
