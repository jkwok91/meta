### About the Organization

Now help us learn a bit more about the overall organization that is applying for
funding.

**Mission Statement**

Our mission is to provide every student, regardless of ethnicity, gender, or
socioeconomic status, the opportunity to experience the joys of hacking because
we believe coding is one of the most empowering things someone can learn. If
we're able to accomplish this, not only does that mean a larger and more
diverse technology workforce, but it means living in a world where more people
create the change they want to see. And that is the world we want to live in.  

**Brief description of the organization**

Hack Club helps high school students start coding clubs. We provide prospective
club leaders with open-source materials for starting clubs and with a supportive
community of leaders around the globe.

Our clubs have gone on to host hackathons with hundreds of participants, build
games to destigmatize sex education, and bring coding education to traditionally
underserved and underrepresented communities.

**Demographics of youth reached by organization in 2015**

_Please use approximate percentages to list the demographics of the youth that
your organization served last year, such as age ranges, race/ethnicity, gender
etc. For example, 25% boys, 75% girls._

- 32% women (compare with 20% female AP CS test takers)
- 37% minorities in tech (compare with 13% African American/Hispanic AP CS test
  takers in USA)

**What were the organization's major achievements in the past year?**

We have achieved a presence in 69 schools across 16 states and 7 countries. Our
clubs span a range of socioeconomic situations -- from schools that are
upper-middle class with access to lots of resources, to schools that have been
labeled "dropout factories"; from schools in the United States to schools in
third world countries.

We've been featured on the TODAY Show, in the cover story of the California
Sunday, in the Daily Dot's 20 Under 20 feature, and in Business Insider, and in
the Forbes 30 Under 30. The publications we've been featured in have a combined
monthly reach of 23 million people.

**Total organizational budget in 2016**

We spent $55,720.73 in 2015. We're expecting to spend $250k in 2016.

**What makes your organization unique, innovative, and/or sets you apart from
other groups doing similar work?**

We are an organization built by students for students. The curriculum is
largely built by the community, which has the advantage of being self-correcting
and continuously improved. Instead of having one teacher/teacher figure lead a
class through a rigid lesson plan, we encourage having an open forum,
self-teaching, and using Google to find answers.

We also place an emphasis on building projects with real tools that will be
live on the internet, rather than merely reviewing theoretical concepts.
(TODO rephrase this; this sounds mad negative)
Hack Club curriculum focuses on shipping projects quickly, resulting in higher
engagement and success.

Furthermore, Hack Club works extremely closely with each of our clubs,
maintaining active communication through an messaging channel, and going so far
as to offer direct advice in the form of weekly check-ins over the phone to
ensure everything is running smoothly.

### About the Project

Please provide us with details about the specific computer science education
project that you would like the RISE Awards to fund.

**Project name**

Hack Club

**Project description (one sentence):**

Hack Club helps high schoolers start coding clubs by providing prospective
club leaders with open-source materials (including curriculum) and a community
of other leaders around the globe.

**Detailed project description (include all activities):**

Hack Club generates starting material for students interested in starting clubs
at their school to use, making the process of creating a club and building a
community much more approachable and frictionless.

Hack Club maintains an online communication channel for students involved in
Hack Clubs, to share knowledge and achievements with peers in a supportive and
inspirational environment.

Hack Club hosts events to guide prospective club leaders towards cultivating a
successful culture within their club and at their school.

Hack Club also hosts occasional hackathons to underscore and put into practice
the emphasis on being prolific and creative.

**Which of the following formats best describes the project you are proposing in
this application:**

- [ ] Summer or holiday program (like a camp or school)
- [ ] Teacher training/workshops
- [ ] Club
- [ ] Afterschool program
- [ ] Weekend program
- [ ] Mentoring
- [ ] Family workshop
- [ ] Other

**Amount of funding requested ($10,000 - $25,000 USD):**

999999999

**Please share a budget breakdown**

_How will funding from RISE be spent?_

**Project start date**

**Project end date**

**Please describe the key milestones/deliverables and timeline for this
project.**

uh

**Who will be leading this project? Include the title and relevant experience.**

Zachary Latta, Executive Director of Hack Club.

A former club leader himself, Latta began Hack Club after he realized how much
of an impact finding peers and forming a coding community made on him in terms
of confidence, mentorship, and impetus to improve. Having run Hack Club for over
a year now, Latta has experience writing curriculum and running workshops.

what am i writing

**Who else will be involved with this project? Include relevant experience and
recruitment strategy for additional program staff and/or volunteers.**

Volunteers, club leaders that are part of the community.

**Why is this project needed in this community?*

There is a dearth of organizations that are by students for students. Since Hack
Club is the first-to-market of these for coding clubs, we have a very unique
opportunity to build the organization that we have always wished existed, and
even more importantly, the curriculum that we want to exist in computer science
education.

### Impact

Please provide more information on who will benefit from the computer science
education project if you receive funding from the RISE Awards.

**Local town (specify)**

Everywhere??????

**Country (specify)**

United States

**Region (specify)**

North America

**Projected total number of youth served by this project**

Infinite; the organization is expected to continue impacting youth indefinitely

**Projected demographics of the youth reached by this project**

_Please use approximate percentages to list the demographics of the youth that
your proposed project will serve this year, such as age ranges, race/ethnicity,
gender etc. For example, 25% boys, 75% girls._

100% awesome

**What are the anticipated results (objectives/outputs) for this project? (list
up to 5)**

1. Expand our reach
2. Build out further curriculum
3. Engage more club leaders and contributors to strengthen community and
   quality of curriculum
4. 
- evolve hack club to org that is built by students for students that has a global
  presence
- accessibility - equality across economic status
- open source; self correcting/generating

**How do you plan to measure and evaluate your results?**

- kpi (key progress indicator)
  - primary: # of clubs; # of members; # attritionn rate; diversity of members

In addition, once the organization grows to a certain level, it should continue
to be an active online community, and the number of active clubs should continue
to grow.

### Sustainability and Scalability

Help us understand how the project you are proposing fits into the larger
context of your organization.

**What is the purpose of your proposal?**

- [ ] Create or add a new program to the organization
- [ ] Expand an existing program to more students, a new population, or a new
  geography
- [ ] Secure funding for an existing program
- [ ] Other

**How do you plan to sustain your project beyond 2016 and beyond this grant?**

More grants.

**Does this project have a post-engagement strategy to keep students connected
with computer science? If yes, please describe.**

Yes. Because we have a strong connections to collegiate hackathons, students
within a Hack Club are very likely to continue building and learning even after
they graduate from their high school Hack Club.
