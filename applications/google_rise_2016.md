### About the Organization

Now help us learn a bit more about the overall organization that is applying for
funding.

**Mission Statement**

Our mission is to provide every student, regardless of ethnicity, gender, or
socioeconomic status, the opportunity to experience the joys of hacking because
we believe coding is one of the most empowering things someone can learn. If
we're able to accomplish this, not only does that mean a larger and more diverse
technology workforce, but it means living in a more empowered world where more
people create the change they want to see. And that is a world we want to live
in

**Brief description of the organization**

Hack Club helps high school students start coding clubs. We provide prospective
club leaders with open-source materials for starting clubs and with a supportive
community of leaders around the globe.

Our clubs have gone on to host hackathons with hundreds of participants, build
games to destigmatize sex education, and bring coding education to traditionally
underserved and underrepresented communities.

**What were the organization's major achievements in the past year?**

We've taken Hack Club from an idea attempted at a single high school to the
beginning of an international movement in 70 schools across 16 states and 7
countries (just started a club in Pakistan!). We've helped start clubs at
schools in a variety of socioeconomic situations, from schools that are
upper-middle class with access to lots of resources to schools that have been
labeled "dropout factories".

We've our content significantly and are now at the point where we have a "club
in a box" to start clubs with.

We did our first fundraise, bringing in $165,765.00 from the Reva & David Logan
Foundation, Joe Lonsdale, the Thiel Foundation, among many other contributors.

We've been featured on the TODAY Show, in the cover story of the California
Sunday, in the Daily Dot's 20 Under 20, in Business Insider, and in the Forbes
30 Under 30. The publications we've been featured in have a combined monthly
reach of 23 million people.

**Total organizational budget in 2016**

We spent $55,720.73 in 2015. We're expecting to spend $250k in 2016.

**What makes your organization unique, innovative, and/or sets you apart from
other groups doing similar work?**

Our clubs and content are built and run by students, for students.

By having high schoolers lead clubs, we're able to bypass the red tape typically
associated with bringing computer science to a school or a community. Where it
can take years to start a new computer science club, starting a Hack Club can
take as little as two weeks. Our leaders don't need to find their own space (the
school is their space), recruit external volunteers (their friends are
volunteers), or hire teachers (they use our pre-written workshops). This model
makes the cost of starting a new club virtually $0 from our end and we think
it'll let us scale where others haven't.

Our content is entirely open source and designed for community contribution.
While we're still in the early stages of driving community contributions, half
of our curriculum has been entirely built by the community. Having our content
open source and accessible to contribution has the advantage of being
self-correcting and continuously improved by club leaders and members.

Additionally, our curriculum isn't built to teach people how to program:
it's built to help our club members become self-taught programmers. Instead of
starting by teaching the fundamentals, we throw our members in at the deep end
by having them build real projects and use Google when they get stuck. By the
end of the first club meeting, everyone has built their first website and
deployed it using git, GitHub, and GitHub Pages.

**Has this organization applied for, or received, funding from Google

### About the Project

Please provide us with details about the specific computer science education
project that you would like the RISE Awards to fund.

**Project name**

Hack Club (the whole organization)

**Project description (one sentence):**

Hack Club helps high schoolers start coding clubs through providing prospective
club leaders with open-source materials and a community of other leaders around
the globe.

**Detailed project description (include all activities):**

We would like RISE to fund the continued expansion of Hack Club. Specifically,
we're looking to bring someone on full-time to lead the development of our
curriculum with the community.

To expand on what Hack Club does:

[TODO]

**Which of the following formats best describes the project you are proposing in
this application:**

- [ ] Summer or holiday program (like a camp or school)
- [ ] Teacher training/workshops
- [X] Club
- [ ] Afterschool program
- [ ] Weekend program
- [ ] Mentoring
- [ ] Family workshop
- [ ] Other

**Amount of funding requested ($10,000 - $25,000 USD):**

$20,000

**Please share a budget breakdown**

_How will funding from RISE be spent?_

Salary for curriculum lead

**Project start date**

March-April 2016

**Project end date**

Undefined

**Please describe the key milestones/deliverables and timeline for this
project.**

By the end of 2016, we plan to have Hack Clubs in over 200 schools, reaching
over 4,000 students.

As we work towards this goal, we'll have to make significant strides in our
curriculum, which will be led by the curriculum lead we hire.

**Who will be leading this project? Include the title and relevant experience.**

Zachary Latta, Executive Director of Hack Club.

A former club leader himself, Latta began Hack Club after he realized how much
of an impact finding peers and forming a coding community made on him in terms
of confidence, mentorship, and impetus to improve. Having run Hack Club for over
a year now, Latta has experience writing curriculum and running workshops.

what am i writing

**Who else will be involved with this project? Include relevant experience and
recruitment strategy for additional program staff and/or volunteers.**

Volunteers, club leaders that are part of the community.

**Why is this project needed in this community?*

There is a dearth of organizations that are by students for students. Since Hack
Club is the first-to-market of these for coding clubs, we have a very unique
opportunity to build the organization that we have always wished existed, and
even more importantly, the curriculum that we want to exist in computer science
education.

### Impact

Please provide more information on who will benefit from the computer science
education project if you receive funding from the RISE Awards.

**Local town (specify)**

N/A - national/international project

**Country (specify)**

Focused on the USA, but we are also starting international clubs

**Region (specify)**

Focused on North America, but we are international

**Projected total number of youth served by this project**

Other organizations that follow our model (DECA, FBLA, Key Club, etc) typically
reach between 100,000 and 300,000 students each year.

That said, these are organizations that only have a presence in the USA. Since
Hack Club is international, we hope we can eventually expand our reach to the
millions.

**Projected demographics of the youth reached by this project**

_Please use approximate percentages to list the demographics of the youth that
your proposed project will serve this year, such as age ranges, race/ethnicity,
gender etc. For example, 25% boys, 75% girls._

100% awesome

**What are the anticipated results (objectives/outputs) for this project? (list
up to 5)**

- evolve hc to org that is built by students for students that has a global
  presence
- accessibility - equality across economic status
- open source; self correcting/generating

**How do you plan to measure and evaluate your results?**

- kpi (key progress indicator)
  - primary: # of clubs; # of members; # attritionn rate; diversity of members

In addition, once the organization grows to a certain level, it should continue
to be an active online community, and the number of active clubs should continue
to grow.

### Sustainability and Scalability

Help us understand how the project you are proposing fits into the larger
context of your organization.

**What is the purpose of your proposal?**

- [ ] Create or add a new program to the organization
- [ ] Expand an existing program to more students, a new population, or a new
  geography
- [ ] Secure funding for an existing program
- [ ] Other

**How do you plan to sustain your project beyond 2016 and beyond this grant?**

More grants.

**Does this project have a post-engagement strategy to keep students connected
with computer science? If yes, please describe.**

We are the post-engagement strategy. Our clubs meet weekly or bi-weekly
throughout the school year and we've received partnership interest from a
variety of computer science summer programs wanting their students to start Hack
Clubs after their program ends.

For the summer, when our clubs are out of session, we hope to partner with the
aforementioned summer programs and eventually run our own hackathons to
continually engage our members.
